# Welcome to `Professional Node`

> The Book is quite old but it's still got the punch!

In this repository, you'll find code snips, explanations and a lot more! The code is based on the snippets found in the book but reading won't explain JS to me or ya! So I have added READMEs here n there to explain the miscellaneous parts of Node and JS!

Happy Coding! See ya.
